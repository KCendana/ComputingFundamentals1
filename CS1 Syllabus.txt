CS1 Syllabus: Measurable Objectives 

Upon completion of this course, the student should be able to:

- Design, create and compile C++ programs within multiple development environments and operating systems, including the use of command-line tools in Unix/Linux.

- Interpret and apply C++ control structures for sequencing, selection and iteration.

- Interpret and implement programmer-defined functions in C++.

- Create and interpret expressions involving arithmetic and logical operators.

- Interpret and apply arrays and simple programmer-defined data structures in C++.

- Modify and expand short programs that use standard conditional and iterative control structures and functions.

- Choose appropriate conditional and iteration constructs for a given programming task.

- Apply the techniques of structured (functional) decomposition to break a program into smaller pieces.

- Analyze and explain the behavior of simple programs.

- Describe, interpret and apply the mechanics of parameter passing.

- Discuss and apply the concept of algorithms in problem-solving processes.

- Judge the correctness and quality of algorithms, identifying necessary properties of good algorithms.

- Describe and apply effective debugging strategies.

- Identify properties of variables and apply different forms of variable binding, visibility, scoping, and lifetime management.

- Explain, interpret and apply elements of syntax related variable types, including type-checking, abstraction, type incompatibility and type safety.

- Demonstrate understanding of fundamental syntax and control structures. This includes variables, arithmetic statements, if statements and loops.

- Explain and implement programmer-defined functions in C++.
